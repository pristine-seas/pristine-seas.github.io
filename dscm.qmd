Since 2012, we have deployed a total of `r totals$n_deployments` deep sea cameras over the world's oceans.  

```{r eval = T, include = T}
all_dscm_deployments %>%
  group_by(deployment_date) |> 
  summarize(deployments = n()) |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  mutate(deployments = cumsum(deployments)) |> 
  hchart("line", 
         hcaes(x = deployment_date, y = deployments)) |> 
  hc_title(text = "Deep sea camera deployments through time") |> 
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Number of deployments")) |> 
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "")) 
```

## Depths 

The deepest camera deployed so far landed at **`r totals$max_depth`** meters in the offshore region of Colombia known as Colinas y Lomas in the Pacific Ocean.

```{r eval = TRUE, include = T}
all_dscm_deployments |> 
  filter(!is.na(max_depth_m)) |>
